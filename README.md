The objective of this project:
To create a basic calculator program that can perform four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program allows users to input two numbers and select the desired operation, then outputs the result.

Key Activities:
Define Functions for Arithmetic Operations:

Create functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) that each perform one of the four arithmetic operations.
User Interface for Operation Selection:

Provide users with a menu to select the desired arithmetic operation by inputting the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
Input Handling:

Prompt users to enter two numbers for the chosen operation.
Implement error handling to ensure valid numeric input.
Performing Calculations:

Based on the user's choice, call the appropriate function with the input numbers and display the result.
Repeat Functionality:

Allow users to perform multiple calculations by asking if they want to continue after each operation.
Error Handling:

Implement input validation to manage invalid choices and handle errors such as non-numericÂ input.
